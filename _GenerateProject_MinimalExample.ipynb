CDK5 is involved in a multitude of neuronal processes, including neurite outgrowth, synapse formation, and neurotransmitter release. Dysregulation of CDK5 has been implicated in various neurological disorders. Overactivation of CDK5 is associated with neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, while reduced CDK5 activity is linked to intellectual disability and impaired cognitive function. Understanding the complex roles of CDK5 in neuronal pathways is essential for developing therapeutic strategies for these conditions.\""
