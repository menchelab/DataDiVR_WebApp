        <h5>Cytoscape Bridge</h5>
        <br>
        For everyone which is not as familiar with coding and handling data
        files we are happy to present a new way to bring networks from the
        widely used network visualization software Cytoscape.
        <br>
        We've developed a Cytoscape application that can be installed with the
        AppManger. This application allow to
        export networks in a data format that can be uploaded to the DataDiVR
        to explore the network in Virtual Reality.
        <br>
        Furthermore, you are also able to send networks directly to a running
        DataDiVR session for a seamless transition. And as if that were not
        enough, the provided bridge is not one directional. Together with the
        CyEx extension you - which is also necessary to upload and receive
        network from Cytoscape - you can select a subset of your network in
        Virtual Reality and send in to Cytoscape. This enables to explore a
        reduced network with the broad tool set provided in Cytoscape.
        <br>
        Please be aware that this bridge is work-in-progress and currently only
        available from the a git repository we provide here:
        <br>
        <a href="https://github.com/menchelab/DataDiVRApp">DataDiVR Cytoscape
            App</a>
        <br>
        Please refer to the README provided in this repo to install both the
        Cytoscape application as well as the CyEx
        extension.
