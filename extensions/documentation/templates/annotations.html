			<h3>How to annotate a project</h3>

			<br>
			In this section we will present you how to annotate nodes of your project. 

			<br><br>
			The DataDiVR has a variety of tools to analyze networks and give the user an intuitive view on the data. Therfore, node annotations are a great way
			to bind (shared) properties and information to nodes and add additional depth to the data.

			<br><br>
			There are currently two ways to annotate your project: basic list-based and advanced type-based annotations.
			
			<br>
			<br>
			<h4>Basic List-Based Annotations</h4><br>

			The basic type of annotations is available for CSV and JSON upladed projects.
			<br><br>

			It stores all annotations internally in one list of strings where an annotation has to be a string:
			(list of strings e.g. ["nodeID", "functionX", "attributeY"]) = e.g. nx.set_node_attributes(G, annotations, "annotation"). Another important
			aspect of this type of annotations is that the first entry in the annotation list will be extracted and used as the display name of the node. 
			This entry will not be used for internal annotation analyzation!
			<br><br>

			To use this type of annotation by uploading the network via the JSON uploader it is important to avoid the boolean "annotationTypes" key or set it to "false".
			<br><br>

			Here you can see how a toy network could be annotated using basic list-based annotations:
			<br><br>
			<pre>
				<code class="javascript">
{
	"directed": false,
	"multigraph": false,
	"textureName": "BasicAnnotation",
	
	"annotationTypes": false,   // set this false or remove the property completly

	"graph": {
		"name": "Basic-Annotation",
		"graphtitle": "Zachary Annotation Basic",
		"graphdesc": "Karateclub toy network for basic annotation demo"
	},
	"nodes": [
		{
			// here are annotations as a list
			// the display name of the node will be "Karate 0"

			"annotation": [
				"Karate 0", "Mr. Hi", "Node 0"
			],

			"pos": [
				0.06287198998515463,
				0.25783949576181114,
				0.3343541170106573
			],
			"nodecolor": "#c90823",
			"id": 0
		}, ...
	], ...
}
				</code>
			</pre>

			<h4>Advanced Type-Based Annotations</h4><br><br>

			This way of annotating your data is ONLY available for the JSON uploader. It comes in handy if you have multiple types of 
			annotations like different types of functions, origin of data, and other kind of subdivideable properties.
			<br><br>

			The annotated data is saved as dictionary where each type is a key and the corresponding annotations are strings in a list.
			In the backend it does look like following for an network of actors:
			<pre>
				<code class="language-python">
""""Code is inside GlobalData""""

# list which contains types of annotations
annotation_types = ["genre", "movie"]

# annotation object
annotations = {
	"genre": {
		"thriller": [... associated nodes ...],
		"fantasy": [... associated nodes ...],
		"horror": [... associated nodes ...],
		"documentation": [... associated nodes ...],
		...
	},
	"movie": {
		"Lord of the rings": [... associated nodes ...],
		"Lord of the rings 2": [... associated nodes ...],
		"Lord of the rings 3": [... associated nodes ...],
		"Howl's moving castle": [... associated nodes ...],
		"Spirited away": [... associated nodes ...],
		...
	}
}
				</code>
			</pre>

			NOTE: Basic list-based annotated projects are saved similarly. However, instead of having multiple types they have
			by default the type "default". This is nowhere exposed to the user but only used internally.

			<br><br>

			To use this kind of annotation you have to set the "annotationTypes" key to true inside of the JSON to upload.
			Furthemore, this format version allows to use also an additional "name" key for each node which decouples the display name of 
			the node from the annotation property. Also, not each type of annotations has to be present in each node.
			<br><br>

			To differentiate inside the backend between both types of annotation for a project you can access the "annotationTypes" key in the PFile of each
			project. If this one holds true the project uses the advanced type of annotations.
			<br><br>

			<pre>
				<code class="javascript">
{
	"directed": false,
	"multigraph": false,
	"textureName": "AdvancedAnnotation",
	
	"annotationTypes": true,   // this must be true

	"graph": {
		"name": "Basic-Annotation",
		"graphtitle": "Actors Annotation Advanced",
		"graphdesc": "Actors network for advanced annotation demo"
	},

	"nodes": [
		{
			// you can set the name of the node
			"name": "Harrison Ford"

			// here are annotations as a dictionary
			"annotation": {
				"genre": [
					"thriller", "fantasy", ...
				],
				"movie": [
					"Indiana Jones", "Indiana Jones 2", "Indiana Jones 3", "Indiana Jones 4", "Indiana Jones 5",
					"Star Wars", ...
				]	
			}

			"pos": [
				0.06287198998515463,
				0.25783949576181114,
				0.3343541170106573
			],
			"nodecolor": "#c90823",
			"id": 0
		}, ...
	], ...
}
